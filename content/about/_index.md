## Who we are

Hip My Trip is currently run by [Danielle Attinella](https://www.loopandlaurel.design), a location indepentent graphic designer currently based in Rome. 

The completely custom [website](https://www.hipmytrip.com) was developed by [Onar Alili](https://onaralili.com)

The maps are designed in Rome and all products ship through a top notch fulfillment company to ensure the highest quality possible. 

A few more facts about the shop:
* Each map order plants one tree in the rainforest through [One Tree Planted](https://onetreeplanted.org/collections/latin-america/products/brazil-forests)
* Each order is completely custom designed (not a program) giving your map the attention it deserves!
* The background patterns/art are either created by me or purchased from artists.
